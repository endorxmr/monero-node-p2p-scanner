# Monero node p2p scanner

Basic python script that scans Monero nodes using the [py-levin](https://github.com/sanderfoobar/py-levin) package under the hood.

If the script hangs while performing a large scan, try setting a lower limit and running it multiple times.

Any improvements and suggestions are welcome.
